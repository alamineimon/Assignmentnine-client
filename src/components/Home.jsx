        The Evolution of Web Development & Its Modern Trends
      </h1>
      <p>
        Looking back to the era where there was no internet is quite difficult.
        With more and more devices connecting regularly to the internet and the
        different types of devices evolving, undoubtedly the internet is rapidly
        growing. The Internet has truly created a global market where one can
        get different services and products offered to users all over the world.
        With the arrival of web applications and IoT, we are now at a phase
        where itâ€™s possible to interact with the internet in a unique and better
        way.
      </p>
      <h4>The Evolution of Web Development</h4>
      <p>
        Web Development was previously only known for the development of web
        pages and websites for both intranet and internet. However, nowadays it
        is more like creating web applications that surpass the complexity as
        well as the size of typical mobile and desktop applications. It can be
        said, web application development is the artsy method to develop complex
        business applications to both business (B2B) and customers (B2C). Due to
        the modern complexity level, web development is done by a supple
        software team. This development was initiated as a way to develop apps
        around 15 years ago. The agile philosophy supports the regular delivery
        of software with the help of highly-motivated tech professionals. This
        agile software also supports frequent deliveries, changing environments,
        and whatnot. The agile team defends technical excellence, continuous
        improvements, great design, and reflection on how one can become more
        efficient

      <h4>#Frontend Development</h4>
      <p>
        Starting from the 2000s, the web has become a popular platform for the
        development of the website by using standard web development
        technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At that time the developer
        used to follow only three steps to get a website or web application
        working.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Write & Save Code <br /> 2. Check whether the file is working
        properly or not from the web browser <br /> 3. Deployment of the web app
        as Netlify by adding files into the program{" "}
      </p>

      <h4>Web FrameWorks and Libraries </h4>
      <p>
        With the ongoing changes on the web, the web platform requirement has
        become more complicated. Coding everything by self took a long period of
        time. The developers who were using JavaScript needed to upgrade the
        cycle for every new project. However, with the involvement of web
        frameworks and libraries were there to solve the problem.
      </p>
      <h5>
        The trending technologies for 2020 based on the report of StackOverflow
        data are:
      </h5>
      <p>
        1. React <br />
        2. Angular <br />
        3. jQuery
      </p>
      <h4>#Backend Development</h4>
      <p>
        Backend is not just limited to the browser instead numerous programs can
        be used to develop it. Some of the previous and latest choices of the
        developers are:
      </p>
      <h5>Python</h5>
      <p>
        According to several surveys in 2019, Python was the most admired
        programming language.{" "}

      <h5>Java</h5>
      <p>
        Java is an independent object-oriented programming language that uses
        the virtual machine. It also makes the codes in Java portable to several
        different platforms. This language is interpreted, simple, and robust
        that helps in developing all the complex applications.
      </p>
      <h5>Git</h5>
      <p>
        Git is a version control system that enables tracking code changes to
        make collaboration among the developers faster, easier, and efficient.
        Before its release, developers used SVN and FTP for checking changes.
        Also, Git is a much friendlier tool that can be used for the same
        purpose of tracking changes.
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        So this was the complete evolution of web development along with the
        changes that have taken place in the last 20 years. It was a real effort
        to put all the turning points of the web together in the same article.
